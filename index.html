          VirtualStadia is a platform that aims to enhance fan experience in cricket by using a concept of cryptography and metaverse. The stadium like environment i.e. metaverse will be created for the fans. And various avatars of fans are created in the metaverse that are used for locomotion. In various parts of that environment there will be variety of fan-friendly games conducted, which will offer rewards in the form of tokens. Live polls, quizzes, mathematical polls, pinball,  hit the mouse, etc. are some of the games in which fans can engage. The count of games will be continuously increasing as per the growth of the platform to enhance the fan experience. Tokens gained can be used to purchase tickets for upcoming offline matches, as well as other merchandise at the stadium or they can be given as gifts to other fans. This environment will have the screens, to watch the live telecast of the matches. Clicking on the screen will give us a full-screen view of the broadcast. And the 360-degree vision of the match is the most attracting feature. In order to increase fan engagement on the site, we will also airdrop the tokens in between matches.
Blockchain technology will be used by the platform to guarantee security, transparency, and automation of token management through smart contracts. This will provide fans with a more secure, engaging and personalized experience.
This states, we have to build an environment of a Virtual Stadium(Mini-Metaverse).
